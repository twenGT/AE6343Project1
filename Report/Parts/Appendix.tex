% Appendices are NOT REQUIRED. Uncomment and use them if needed.
% They will not be graded! Appendices are only for supplemental information, not essential information.
% As such, they do not count towards the maximum page length.
% You cannot put figures and tables here and gain space in the actual body of the report. If required stuff is not within the main body of the report, you will receive zero points for those things.
% Again: appendices will not be graded.
